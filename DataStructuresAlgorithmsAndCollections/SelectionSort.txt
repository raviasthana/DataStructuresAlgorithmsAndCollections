Selection Sort
==============
Selection sort is conceptually the simplest sorting algorithm. This algorithm finds the smallest element in
the array/list and exchanges it with the element in the first position, then it finds the second smallest 
element and exchanges it with element at the second position. It continues this way till entire array is sorted.

How Selection Sort works
------------------------

	3	6	1	8	4	5
	<-------> 1st pass (put 1 in 1st position and 3 in place of 1)
	1	6	3	8	4	5 (after 1st pass)
		<---> 2nd pass (put 3 in second position and 6 in place of 3)
	1	3	6	8	4	5 (after 2nd pass)
			<-------> 3rd pass (put 4 in 3rd position and 6 in place of 4)
	1	3	4	8	6	5 (after 3rd pass)
				<-------> 4th pass (put 5 in 4th position and 8 in place of 5)
	1	3	4	5	6	8 (after 4th pass)
	1	3	4	5	6	8 (after 5th pass as nothing to sort in this pass)
	
Complexity Analysis of Selection Sort
=====================================

Worst Case Time Complexity: O(n^2)
Best Case Time Complexity: 	O(n^2)
Average Time Complexity: 	O(n^2)
Space Complexity: 			O(1)
